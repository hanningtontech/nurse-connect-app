# 🚀 Firebase Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites

1. **Authenticate with Firebase CLI**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

2. **Set active project** (replace with your actual project ID):
   ```bash
   firebase use nurseconnect-c68eb
   ```

## Deploy Updated Rules and Indexes

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Deploy Firestore Indexes
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### 3. Deploy Storage Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### 4. Deploy All at Once
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage
```

## ✅ What We've Updated

### 🛡️ **Storage Security Rules Enhanced**
- Added file size limits (5MB for profile images)
- Added content type validation (only JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Improved user ownership validation
- Fixed profile image path security

### 🔧 **Build Configuration Optimized**
- Updated `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` to stable version 34
- Enabled ProGuard minification for release builds
- Added resource shrinking for smaller APK size
- Updated dependencies to latest secure versions

### 🔒 **Network Security Hardened**
- Disabled cleartext HTTP traffic
- Created secure network configuration
- Added proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
- Firebase-only HTTPS connections enforced

### 📦 **Dependencies Updated**
- Firebase BOM: `32.7.2` → `32.8.0`
- Play Services Auth: `20.7.0` → `21.0.0`
- WebRTC: `1.0.7` → `1.0.8`

### 🛠️ **ProGuard Rules Added**
- Complete rules for Firebase, WebRTC, Glide, Retrofit
- Debug log removal for release builds
- Model class preservation
- Native method protection

### 📊 **Firestore Index Fixed**
- Updated private_chats index to use DESCENDING order
- Fixed query performance issues
- Proper participant array indexing

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. **Test the app** to ensure all features work correctly
2. **Monitor Firebase console** for any errors after deployment
3. **Check app performance** with the new optimizations
4. **Verify security rules** are working as expected

## 🔍 **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Storage rules deployed successfully
- [ ] Firestore rules deployed successfully
- [ ] Firestore indexes created and enabled
- [ ] App builds without errors
- [ ] Private messaging works (no index errors)
- [ ] Profile image uploads respect new size limits
- [ ] Release build is properly minified

## 🚨 **If You Encounter Issues**

### Index Deployment Issues
If automatic index deployment fails, manually create the index in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Indexes
2. Create composite index for `private_chats`:
   - Collection: `private_chats`
   - Fields: `participants` (Array), `updatedAt` (Descending), `__name__` (Descending)

### Build Issues
If the app fails to build after changes:
1. Clean the project: `./gradlew clean`
2. Rebuild: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
3. Check for any ProGuard rule conflicts

### Security Rule Issues
If uploads fail after deployment:
1. Check Firebase Console → Storage → Rules for syntax errors
2. Verify file sizes are under 5MB
3. Ensure file types are JPEG, PNG, or WebP
