# Calling System Fixes - Version 2

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Multiple Calls Being Received**
**Problem**: When making a call, multiple call activities were being started on the receiver's side.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `setupCallStatusMonitoring()` method was triggering for every call with status "calling"
- No cleanup of call status listeners
- No protection against duplicate call handling

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Added call status listener cleanup** in `PrivateChatActivity.java`:
   ```java
   private com.google.firebase.firestore.ListenerRegistration callStatusListener;
   ```

2. **Added duplicate call prevention flag**:
   ```java
   private boolean isHandlingIncomingCall = false;
   ```

3. **Added timestamp validation** to only handle recent calls:
   ```java
   Long startTime = latestCall.getLong("startTime");
   if (startTime != null && (System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime) < 30000) {
       handleIncomingCall(callId, callType);
   }
   ```

4. **Proper listener cleanup** in `onDestroy()`:
   ```java
   if (callStatusListener != null) {
       callStatusListener.remove();
       callStatusListener = null;
   }
   isHandlingIncomingCall = false;
   ```

### 2. **No Audio Communication Between Peers**
**Problem**: WebRTC calls were being initialized but no actual audio communication was established.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `RealTimeAudioManager.startCall()` method was not being called for outgoing calls
- WebRTC signaling wasn't being initiated properly

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Fixed outgoing call initialization** in `AudioCallActivity.java`:
   ```java
   // For outgoing calls, start the WebRTC call immediately
   if (realTimeAudioManager != null) {
       realTimeAudioManager.startCall();
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed call document waiting** in `waitForCallDocument()`:
   ```java
   // Start the WebRTC call
   if (realTimeAudioManager != null) {
       realTimeAudioManager.startCall();
   }
   ```

3. **Ensured proper call flow**:
   - Outgoing calls: Initialize audio → Start WebRTC call immediately
   - Incoming calls: Initialize audio → Wait for user to accept → Start WebRTC call

## Technical Details

### WebRTC Signaling Flow
1. **Caller initiates call** → Creates call document → Starts WebRTC as initiator
2. **Receiver gets notification** → Opens call activity → Waits for user action
3. **Receiver accepts call** → Starts WebRTC as answerer → Signaling begins
4. **Both peers exchange**:
   - SDP offers/answers via Firestore signaling subcollection
   - ICE candidates for NAT traversal
   - Audio streams are established

### Firestore Rules
The signaling subcollection rules ensure secure communication:
```javascript
match /signaling/{signalId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
    (request.auth.uid == get(/databases/$(database.name)/documents/calls/$(callId)).data.callerId ||
     request.auth.uid == get(/databases/$(database.name)/documents/calls/$(callId)).data.receiverId);
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Test Outgoing Calls**
1. Open a private chat with another user
2. Tap the voice call button
3. Verify only one call notification appears on receiver's device
4. Accept the call on receiver's device
5. Verify audio communication is established

### 2. **Test Incoming Calls**
1. Have another user call you
2. Verify only one call notification appears
3. Accept the call
4. Verify audio communication is established

### 3. **Test Call Controls**
1. During an active call, test:
   - Mute/unmute functionality
   - Speaker toggle
   - Call duration display
   - End call functionality

## Expected Results

✅ **Single Call Notifications**: Only one call notification per call attempt
✅ **Audio Communication**: Both users can hear each other clearly
✅ **Call Controls**: Mute, speaker, and end call work properly
✅ **Call Status**: Proper call state management (calling → connected → ended)
✅ **Cleanup**: No memory leaks or duplicate listeners

## Files Modified

1. **`PrivateChatActivity.java`**:
   - Added call status listener management
   - Added duplicate call prevention
   - Added timestamp validation for calls
   - Improved listener cleanup

2. **`AudioCallActivity.java`**:
   - Fixed WebRTC call initialization for outgoing calls
   - Ensured proper call flow for both outgoing and incoming calls

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules**: Ensure the signaling subcollection rules are deployed
2. **Test End-to-End**: Verify complete call flow between different users
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any remaining issues in logcat
4. **Performance Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent calls

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check logcat for WebRTC initialization errors
2. Verify Firestore rules are deployed correctly
3. Ensure both devices have proper internet connectivity
4. Check that audio permissions are granted on both devices
