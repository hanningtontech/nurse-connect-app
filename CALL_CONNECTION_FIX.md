# Call Connection Fix

## Problem Identified

The app was experiencing an issue where:
- **Caller** would stay in "calling" state indefinitely
- **Receiver** would show "connected" state
- **No actual audio communication** was happening between the parties

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by an **incomplete call flow** where:

1. **Caller** creates call with status "calling"
2. **Receiver** accepts call, updates status to "accepted" 
3. **Caller** receives "accepted" status and calls `connectCall()`
4. **Caller** updates status to "connected" in Firestore
5. **Receiver** receives "connected" status but **never calls `connectCall()`** because they're not in CALLING state

The **receiver was missing the WebRTC initialization** because:
- The `acceptCall()` method was calling `connectCall()` immediately (race condition)
- The status listener wasn't properly set up for incoming calls
- The receiver wasn't listening for call status changes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Call Status Listener Logic**
```java
case "accepted":
    if (currentCallState == CallState.CALLING && isOutgoing) {
        // Caller receives acceptance - now connect the call
        connectCall();
    } else if (currentCallState == CallState.RINGING && !isOutgoing) {
        // Receiver: Call was accepted, connect the call
        connectCall();
    }
    break;
```

### 2. **Removed Race Condition in `acceptCall()`**
```java
// Before: Called connectCall() immediately (race condition)
// After: Let status listener handle the connection
.addOnSuccessListener(aVoid -> {
    android.util.Log.d("AudioCallActivity", "Call accepted in Firestore - waiting for status listener to handle connection");
    // Don't call connectCall() here - let the status listener handle it
    // This prevents race conditions and ensures proper flow
})
```

### 3. **Added Status Listener for Incoming Calls**
```java
private void setupIncomingCall() {
    currentCallState = CallState.RINGING;
    callStatus.setText("Incoming call...");
    
    // Show incoming call interface
    incomingCallSection.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
    bottomSection.setVisibility(View.GONE);
    
    // Start listening for call status changes (for incoming calls)
    listenForCallStatusChanges();
    
    playRingtone();
}
```

## Call Flow Now Works As Follows

### For Outgoing Calls (Caller):
1. **Create call** → Status: "calling"
2. **Wait for acceptance** → Listen for status changes
3. **Receive "accepted"** → Call `connectCall()`
4. **Initialize WebRTC** → Start audio connection
5. **Update status** → Status: "connected"

### For Incoming Calls (Receiver):
1. **Receive call** → Status: "calling" (from caller)
2. **Show incoming UI** → Accept/decline buttons
3. **Accept call** → Update status to "accepted"
4. **Status listener triggers** → Call `connectCall()`
5. **Initialize WebRTC** → Start audio connection
6. **Update status** → Status: "connected"

## Key Changes Made

### AudioCallActivity.java
- **Fixed status listener logic**: Both caller and receiver now properly handle "accepted" status
- **Removed race condition**: `acceptCall()` no longer calls `connectCall()` directly
- **Added listener for incoming calls**: Receiver now listens for status changes
- **Enhanced logging**: Added `isOutgoing` parameter to debug logs

## Testing

The fix ensures:
- ✅ **Caller** transitions from "calling" → "connected"
- ✅ **Receiver** transitions from "ringing" → "connected"  
- ✅ **Both parties** initialize WebRTC properly
- ✅ **Audio communication** is established
- ✅ **No race conditions** in call acceptance flow

## Debugging

Use these logcat filters to monitor the fix:
```
AudioCallActivity|WebRTCManager|RealTimeAudioManager
```

Look for these key log messages:
- `"Call accepted by receiver, connecting call..."` (caller)
- `"Receiver: Call was accepted, connecting call..."` (receiver)
- `"Call accepted in Firestore - waiting for status listener to handle connection"`
- `"Call status updated to connected"`

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Caller makes call** → Shows "Calling..."
2. **Receiver gets notification** → Shows "Incoming call..."
3. **Receiver accepts** → Both parties show "Connected"
4. **Audio communication** → Both parties can hear each other
5. **Call termination** → Both parties end properly

This fix ensures that both caller and receiver properly establish WebRTC connections for live audio communication.
