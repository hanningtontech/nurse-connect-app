# Calling Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Inconsistent Call Acceptance Flow**
**Problem**: One phone was showing call acceptance dialog while the other was starting calls directly.

**Root Cause**: The call flow was inconsistent between caller and receiver. The caller was initializing WebRTC immediately without waiting for the receiver to accept.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `AudioCallActivity.initiateOutgoingCall()` to wait for receiver acceptance before starting WebRTC
- Improved call status monitoring to ensure proper flow: `calling` → `accepted` → `connected`
- Added proper validation and error handling for missing call parameters

### 2. **WebRTC State Management Error**
**Problem**: "Failed to set remote answer sdp: Called in wrong state" error occurring during call establishment.

**Root Cause**: WebRTC peer connection was being used in incorrect signaling states due to improper state checking.

**Solution**:
- Added proper state validation in `WebRTCManager.createAnswer()` and signaling methods
- Fixed enum value from `HAVE_OFFER` to `HAVE_REMOTE_OFFER` (correct WebRTC enum)
- Added checks for peer connection state before setting remote descriptions
- Improved error handling with specific state information

### 3. **Call Termination Issues**
**Problem**: When one user ended the call, it didn't properly end on the other side.

**Root Cause**: Incomplete call termination signaling and improper cleanup.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `SignalingManager.sendCallEnd()` to update both signaling and main call document
- Improved `AudioCallActivity.endCall()` with proper cleanup sequence
- Added call status monitoring for "ended" status to ensure both parties terminate
- Better resource cleanup in `WebRTCManager.endCall()`

### 4. **Call Flow Inconsistency**
**Problem**: Different behavior between caller and receiver sides.

**Root Cause**: Lack of proper synchronization between call states and WebRTC initialization.

**Solution**:
- Standardized call flow: Caller creates call → Receiver accepts → Both connect WebRTC
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging call flow
- Improved call status listener to handle all states properly
- Added validation for required call parameters

## Key Changes Made

### AudioCallActivity.java
- **Fixed call acceptance flow**: Receiver must accept before WebRTC starts
- **Improved call status monitoring**: Better handling of all call states
- **Enhanced error handling**: Validation and proper error messages
- **Better logging**: Comprehensive debug information for troubleshooting
- **Proper cleanup**: Improved resource management and call termination

### WebRTCManager.java
- **State validation**: Check peer connection state before operations
- **Fixed enum usage**: Correct WebRTC SignalingState enum values
- **Better error handling**: Specific error messages with state information
- **Improved ICE candidate handling**: Check connection state before adding candidates

### SignalingManager.java
- **Enhanced call termination**: Update both signaling and main call document
- **Better message processing**: Improved handling of all signaling message types
- **Proper cleanup**: Clean up signaling data when calls end

## Call Flow Now Works As Follows

1. **Caller initiates call**:
   - Creates call document in Firestore with status "calling"
   - Shows "Calling..." interface
   - Waits for receiver to accept

2. **Receiver receives call**:
   - Gets notification and opens AudioCallActivity
   - Shows incoming call interface with accept/decline buttons
   - Must explicitly accept the call

3. **Call acceptance**:
   - Receiver updates call status to "accepted"
   - Caller receives status change and connects WebRTC
   - Both parties initialize audio connection

4. **Call connection**:
   - WebRTC establishes peer-to-peer connection
   - Audio streams are exchanged
   - Call status updates to "connected"

5. **Call termination**:
   - Either party can end call
   - Signaling message sent to other party
   - Both parties clean up resources
   - Call status updates to "ended"

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test call acceptance flow**:
   - Verify receiver sees accept/decline dialog
   - Verify caller waits for acceptance before connecting

2. **Test call termination**:
   - End call from caller side - verify receiver ends
   - End call from receiver side - verify caller ends

3. **Test error scenarios**:
   - Network disconnection during call
   - App backgrounding during call
   - Multiple call attempts

4. **Test WebRTC connection**:
   - Verify audio quality
   - Test mute/unmute functionality
   - Test speaker toggle

## Debugging

The code now includes comprehensive logging. Check logcat for:
- `AudioCallActivity` tags for call flow
- `WebRTCManager` tags for WebRTC state changes
- `SignalingManager` tags for signaling messages

This should resolve all the calling issues you were experiencing.
