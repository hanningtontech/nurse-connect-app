# Calling System Fixes - Nurse Connect

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Multiple Calls Issue
**Problem**: Multiple call activities were being launched simultaneously due to:
- Both `PrivateChatActivity` and `CallNotificationService` listening for incoming calls
- Missing proper state management to prevent duplicate call handling

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `isHandlingIncomingCall` flag with 5-second delay reset in `PrivateChatActivity`
- Improved call status monitoring to check if already handling a call
- Fixed timestamp field reference in `CallNotificationService` (changed from `timestamp` to `startTime`)

### 2. WebRTC Connection Issues
**Problem**: WebRTC connections were failing due to:
- Missing proper SDP semantics configuration
- Incomplete ICE server setup
- Missing security configurations

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added explicit `UNIFIED_PLAN` SDP semantics
- Enhanced ICE server configuration with TCP candidates
- Removed invalid WebRTC configuration properties that don't exist in the API

### 3. Audio Communication Issues
**Problem**: No audio communication between peers due to:
- WebRTC calls not being started properly
- Missing call initialization in `AudioCallActivity`
- Improper call state management

**Fixes Applied**:
- Modified `initializeAudio()` to start WebRTC calls immediately after parameter setup
- Improved `connectCall()` method with proper state management
- Added Firestore call status updates

### 4. Compilation Errors
**Problem**: Build failures due to:
- Invalid `enableDtlsSrtp` and `enableRtpDataChannel` properties in `RTCConfiguration`
- Non-existent `getSignalingState()` method in `PeerConnection`

**Fixes Applied**:
- Removed invalid WebRTC configuration properties
- Simplified signaling message processing to avoid API compatibility issues

## Files Modified

### 1. `PrivateChatActivity.java`
- Enhanced call status monitoring with duplicate prevention
- Added 5-second delay for call handling flag reset
- Improved logging for better debugging

### 2. `CallNotificationService.java`
- Fixed timestamp field reference (`startTime` instead of `timestamp`)
- Improved call filtering logic

### 3. `WebRTCManager.java`
- Added explicit `UNIFIED_PLAN` SDP semantics
- Enhanced ICE configuration
- Removed invalid configuration properties

### 4. `AudioCallActivity.java`
- Modified `initializeAudio()` to start WebRTC calls immediately
- Improved `connectCall()` method with proper state management
- Added Firestore call status updates

### 5. `SignalingManager.java`
- Simplified answer processing to avoid API compatibility issues
- Removed invalid signaling state checks

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Call Initiation
1. Open a private chat with another user
2. Tap the voice call button
3. Verify that only one call activity is launched
4. Check logs for proper WebRTC initialization

### 2. Test Incoming Calls
1. Have another user initiate a call
2. Verify that only one notification appears
3. Accept the call and verify audio connection
4. Check that no duplicate call activities are created

### 3. Test Audio Communication
1. Once call is connected, verify audio transmission
2. Test mute/unmute functionality
3. Test speaker toggle
4. Verify call duration tracking

## Expected Logs

### Successful Call Flow
```
PrivateChatActivity: Call document created successfully with callId: [callId]
AudioCallActivity: Initializing WebRTC audio for call: [callId]
WebRTCManager: WebRTC initialized successfully
WebRTCManager: Peer connection created successfully with Unified Plan SDP semantics
WebRTCManager: ICE connection state: CONNECTED
AudioCallActivity: Real-time audio call connected - audio channel established
```

### Multiple Call Prevention
```
PrivateChatActivity: Already handling incoming call, ignoring: [callId]
CallNotificationService: Ignoring old call from: [callerName] (timestamp: [timestamp])
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Firestore Rules
Ensure your Firestore rules allow proper access to the `calls` collection:

```javascript
match /calls/{callId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    (request.auth.uid == resource.data.callerId || 
     request.auth.uid == resource.data.receiverId);
}
```

### 2. Network Configuration
Make sure your app has proper network security configuration for WebRTC:

```xml
<!-- network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">your-webrtc-server.com</domain>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

### 3. Permissions
Ensure all required permissions are declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `RECORD_AUDIO`
- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`
- `INTERNET`
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`

## Troubleshooting

### If Calls Still Don't Work:
1. Check WebRTC logs for connection errors
2. Verify Firestore rules are properly configured
3. Ensure both devices have stable internet connections
4. Check that ICE servers are accessible

### If Multiple Calls Still Occur:
1. Verify the `isHandlingIncomingCall` flag is working
2. Check that call status monitoring is properly filtered
3. Ensure call documents are being cleaned up after calls end

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Two Devices**: Use two physical devices to test the complete call flow
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any remaining errors in the logcat
3. **Performance Testing**: Test call quality and stability over different network conditions
4. **Video Call Implementation**: Once audio calls work, implement video calling functionality

---

**Note**: These fixes address the core issues with the calling system. The WebRTC implementation should now provide stable audio communication between peers. The project now compiles successfully without errors.
